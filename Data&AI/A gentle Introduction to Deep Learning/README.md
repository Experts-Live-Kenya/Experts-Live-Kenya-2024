# A Gentle Introduction to Deep Learning

Artificial intelligence relies on a few mathematical principles that can seem scary when you look at them from a distance. But if you take a step by step approach, you will find that the math involved is not too complex and that any software developer can understand the basics. In this session, Laurent Bugnion, a Cloud Advocate working with Microsoft will share his recent journey discovering the basics of Deep Learning. We will not make data scientists out of you, but we will enable you to understand what people talk about when they mention artificial intelligence. We will see how Azure can help you with tools, services and machines. Last but not least, we will also have a discussion about the ethics of AI and what we should be careful about.
